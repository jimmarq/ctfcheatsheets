dig -x 192.168.0.1 # DNS reverse lookup

nmap -p1-65535 # Tells nmap to scan all ports
nmap -T0 / nmap -T5 # T0 is slowest scanning speed, T5 is fastest speed, and 1-4 are in-between
nmap -v /-vv /-vvv # Increase nmap's verbosity, or the amount of information given about the scan in progress
nmap -r # randomized port scanning order. Good for avoiding detection
