ls && cat file.txt # Use && to run two separate commands
netstat # show network statistics
cd # change directory
* cd /   # root dirc of current drive 
rm # removes specified file

sudo !! # redo the last command but as root

ctrl+x+e # open an editor to run a command

# create a fast ram disk
mkdir -p /mnt/ram
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/ram -0 size=8192M

#dont add command to history 
 ls -l # (make sure to add the leading space as this is very important)

fc #opens last command in editor to change a mistake

# tunel with ssh (local port 3337 -> remote host's 127.0.0.1 on port 6379)
#good way to acces private data on cloud server without exposing port # publicly
ssh -L 3337:127.0.0.1:6379 root@emkc.org -N

bg #put somthing in the background

#create folders quickly, in this case 6. -p creates parent folders
mkdir -p folder/{sub1,sub2}/{sub1,sub2,sub3}
# if you need 100 folders with 100 folders in each
mkdir -p folder/{1..100}/{1..100}
# this will create 1000 folders with one command. 

#intercept stdout and log to a file
cat file | tee -a log | cat > /dev/null

#exit terminal and leave all processes running
disown -a && exit


df # check disk space usage (Ex. df -a It includes all the dummy files also in the output which are actually having zero block sizes).
du #used to estimate file space usage (ex: "du -c" shows the full output and append a total line).
mv #moves files/directories from one place to another (ex: "mv myfile mynewfilename" # renames 'myfile' to 'mynewfilename').
pwd # shows the present working directory.
grep # search the contents of a file.
chown # allows you to change the owner and group owner of a file.
*chown [options] new_owner object(s)
*chown alice file1 dir1

traceroute #Trace the route to HOST 

cat # the cat command which short for “concatenate”, lists the contents of files to the terminal window

ps # shows what current processes are running.
ps -A # View all the running processes ex:[root@rhel7 ~]# ps -A
ps -e # View all the running processesex:[root@rhel7 ~]# ps -e
ps -C command_name #Selects process by command name

w # shows what users are currently logged in and their load averages. Also shows other useful information, such as login name, remote host, etc

find # searches through files, strings, and directories to find anything that has that file name that is given

sha1sum # generate a sha1sum for the message digest of a file, string, IP address, etc.

ls -a # show all hidden files in directory

> # output redirect, takes the command to the left of the '>' operator and outputs it into what is on the right side (ex: music.mp3 > /user/music)

>> # append the contents of one file into the end of another (used together with the cat command ex: cat file1 >> file2)

dig # query DNS name server information (ex: dig linx.org)

head # print first ten lines of a file (ex: head /etc/passwd)

tail # print last ten lines of a file (ex: tail access.log)
