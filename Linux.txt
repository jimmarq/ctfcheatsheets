ls && cat file.txt # Use && to run two separate commands
netstat # show network statistics
cd # change directory
rm # removes specified file




df # check disk space usage (Ex. df -a It includes all the dummy files also in the output which are actually having zero block sizes.)
du #used to estimate file space usage (ex: "du -c" shows the full output and append a total line)
mv #moves files/directories from one place to another (ex: "mv myfile mynewfilename" # renames 'myfile' to 'mynewfilename')
pwd # shows the present working directory
grep # search the contents of a file 
chown # allows you to change the owner and group owner of a file
traceroute #Trace the route to HOST 

cat # the cat command which short for “concatenate”, lists the contents of files to the terminal window

ps #shows what current processes are running

w # shows what users are currently logged in and their load averages. Also shows other useful information, such as login name, remote host, etc

find # searches through files, strings, and directories to find anything that has that file name that is given

sha1sum # generate a sha1sum for the message digest of a file, string, IP address, etc.

ls -a # show all hidden files in directory

> # output redirect, takes the command to the left of the '>' operator and outputs it into what is on the right side (ex: music.mp3 > /user/music)

dig # query DNS name server information (ex: dig linx.org)

head # print first ten lines of a file (ex: head /etc/passwd)

tail # print last ten lines of a file (ex: tail access.log)
